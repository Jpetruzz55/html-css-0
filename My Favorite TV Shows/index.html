           <h2>Better Call Saul</h2> 
           <img src="images/bettercallsaul.jpg" width="200" length="300"
           align="left">
           <p>Better Call Saul is packed with visual metaphors, visual cues, subtle foreshadowing, shocking revelations 
            and layered meanings. Better Call Saul has the most epic cinematography I have ever seen after Breaking Bad. 
            The wide angle shots, the silence, change of colors, specific object, certain behavior and habits, the relationship 
            between the characters can tell a lot more than it looks. You can easily empathize with the characters without lines
             or further explanation on the situation. Just by going through what they are experiencing, look at things from their
             perspectives, their facial expression, body language, you will have a better understanding of where they are coming from, 
             reason, purpose and motive behind their actions. The casts portrayed their characters with genuine, realistic, natural and 
             phenomenal acting. The writing/script/plot was exceptionally engaging and intriguing, character transformation was sensible 
             and memorable. I'm amazed of how this show actively builds up a sense of reality by focusing on the right details without 
             being bored. When a character faces a logistical challenge or even just a tedious one, there is no skipping ahead or hitting 
             fast forward, we live with them every step of the way. Each of the scenes where we go through a process with the characters, 
             it keeps us connected closer with the characters and further enforces the reality of the world they live in. It forces us to 
             live through their experiences with them like we are watching real people in real danger, how they deal with life or death 
             situations. You will completely immerse yourself into the scenarios or scenes where you can resonate with the character's 
             emotions, rationale and struggles under certain circumstances. Even in lengthy scenes without dialogue, when they feel 
             frustrated, anxious or even stressed, you will feel the same way too. The plot only ever gets more and more suspenseful 
             and compelling, there is never a dull moment in this show. Everything that happens has symbolized significant meaning to 
             the character development, if not obvious at first, but slowly you will find out every scene happens for a reason. 
             Season 6 has answered a lot of questions from Breaking Bad, we already know the ending of the characters, yet we stick 
             around to find out what happens led to their ending.

            <p>This is a great show. The absurdity and stupidity of each of the characters create a recipe for a show that 
                would be stale and stupid, but when this show is paired up with the witty, controversial humor and spectacular 
                writing of its creators, it becomes a wonderfully unique show that is hilarious in all aspects. This is why this 
                show has solidified its place among the legendary cartoons of the late 20th and 21st centuries.
